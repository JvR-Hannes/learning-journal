            <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
            <p>
                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
                of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h2 class="content-titles">First steps...</h2>
            <p>
                I have been doing coding on and off for a few years now, learning HTML, CSS and C#.
                I received my <strong>Foundational C# with Microsoft Certification</strong> hosted by freeCodeCamp in 2024.
                During this time, Javascript always seemed to make a presence in the projects I was working on.<br>
                <br>So I started searching where I could learn this language that seems to pop-up everywhere<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I found this amazing platform, <strong>Scrimba</strong>, where I could learn all the basics of web development
                in a fun and interactive way.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                After starting the Javascript course, I quickly realized that I wanted to learn more and
                become a better developer.<br>
                The Career Path is well structured and easy to follow.
                So I decided to take the leap and join the Bootcamp.
