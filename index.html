            <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
            <p>
                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
                of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h2 class="content-titles">First steps...</h2>
            <p>
                I have been doing coding on and off for a few years now, learning HTML, CSS and C#.
                I received my <strong>Foundational C# with Microsoft Certification</strong> hosted by freeCodeCamp in 2024.
                During this time, Javascript always seemed to make a presence in the projects I was working on.<br>
                <br>So I started searching where I could learn this language that seems to pop-up everywhere<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I found this amazing platform, <strong>Scrimba</strong>, where I could learn all the basics of web development
                in a fun and interactive way.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                After starting the Javascript course, I quickly realized that I wanted to learn more and
                become a better developer.<br>
                The Career Path is well structured and easy to follow.
                So I decided to take the leap and join the Bootcamp.

            <h2 class="content-titles">Path to Excellence.</h2>
            <p>
                After several tries, I finally completed my first solo project, a Scoreboard app.
                It was a challenging but rewarding experience.
                I learned a lot about Javascript and how to structure my code.<br><br>

                Struggling with the project made me realize how much I still have to learn.
                Some concepts were hard to grasp, but I kept pushing through, still unsure about some parts of my code.<br><br>

                I know there is always room for improvement, and I'm eager to learn more and become a better developer.<br><br>

                I also learned a lot about Git and GitHub, which are essential tools for any developer.<br>
                I am excited to continue my journey as a Scrimba Bootcamp student and see where it takes me.

            <h2 class="content-titles">Develop with purpose</h2>
            <p>
                Just recently, I completed my second solo project, a Converter app.
                This project was a bit more challenging than the first one, but I learned a lot from it.<br><br>
                I had to use more advanced concepts and think more critically about how to structure my code.<br>

                I had to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part individually.<br><br>
                This project also made me realize the importance of planning and designing before starting to code.<br>
                I spent a lot of time thinking about the user experience and how to make the app easy to use.<br><br>
                I am proud of what I have accomplished so far, but I know there is still a long way to go.<br>
                I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills as a developer.

            <h2 class="content-titles">Learn by doing</h2>
            <p>
                Since I started using the <strong>Scrimba</strong> platform, I have heard a lot of great tips during
                the courses and sessions, but the one that stuck with me the most is to "learn by doing".<br><br>
                This means that the best way to learn is to actually build something, rather than just reading
                or watching videos.<br><br>
                I have found this to be true in my own experience.
                The more I practice coding and building projects, the more I learn and the better I become.<br><br>
                I am excited to continue building more projects and learning new skills as I progress through the Bootcamp.

            <h2 class="content-titles">Stepping into a new chapter</h2>
            <p>
                In the Frontend Developer Career Path, I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                I had some interesting lessons on CSS that cleared up a few questions.<br><br>
                I have completed several projects, including a Scoreboard app and a Converter app.
                Some projects were more of my own ideas, while others were more guided.<br><br>

                In the coming months, I will be stepping into a new chapter of my learning journey, the last
                stretch of the Frontend Developer Career Path.<br>
                I am excited to learn more about advanced Javascript concepts and frameworks like React, using API's,
                and building more complex projects.<br><br>
                I am also looking forward to getting expert code reviews and feedback from my peers in the Bootcamp.
                I know this will help me improve my skills and become a better developer.
